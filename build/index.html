            <h3>Why should I participate in OVDP?</h3>

            <p>The Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures (“Streamlined”), another tax amnesty program offered by the IRS, is an alternative to OVDP. Streamlined presents a very attractive opportunity for taxpayers to be compliant with their tax duties and avoid possible IRS enforcement action.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-6">
            <h2>Who can apply for Streamlined?</h2>
            <p>Whether you are a U.S. resident or a non-U.S. resident, you are eligible to use the streamlined procedure as long as your failure to report foreign financial accounts was resulted from non-willful conduct.</p>

            <h2>Why should I participate in Streamlined?</h2>
            <p>Failure to file and pay penalties may be imposed in accordance with the U.S. federal tax law. However, through Streamlined, you can avoid such penalties by paying fixed penalties:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>U.S. residents are subject to a 5% miscellaneous offshore penalty on the previously undisclosed foreign accounts. </li>
              <li>All penalties for non-U.S. resident are FULLY waived.</li>

            <p>Instead of entering the OVDP or Streamlined, you may file or amend previously unreported offshore financial assets past the due dates through “quiet disclosures”.</p>
            <p>As long as you present that there was a reasonable cause for not disclosing your foreign assets on time, then the penalties regarding failure to disclose may be FULLY waived.</p>
            <p>However, once an IRS examination regarding the validity of “reasonable cause” has been started, then you are no longer eligible for the OVDP, which offers more beneficial penalty structure.</p>
